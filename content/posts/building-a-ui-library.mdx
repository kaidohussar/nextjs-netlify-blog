<em>
    Building a UI component library is great for for multiple reasons, but choosing the right tools for it might be a bit tricky.
</em>

<em>
    In this post, I will list out my thoughts and opinions on how to construct a UI library, how to make it follow a <b>design system</b>, and what <b>tools to consider</b>.
</em>

### What is a UI library?

A UI library is a set of ready-made reusable UI components.
It is a tool that provides developers a wide range of building blocks, is usually <b>guided by clearly set up standards</b>, that can be assembled together to build <b>any number of applications</b>.

### Why would you need one?
Having a UI library used for multiple applications is really good to:

- Standardize development
- Reduce code duplications
- Improve collaboration between teams

### What is a design system?
Design System is a comprehensive guide for project design – a collection of **rules**, **principles**, **constraints**, and **best practices**.

It gives developers and designers a more structured and guided way to build solutions.

### Implementing a design system into the UI library
Building a UI library usually comes with building a design system alongside it.
All the components should follow strictly set patterns - spacings, colors, typography, etc.

### What technologies to use?
After trying and investigating multiple technologies I personally think the 2 best options on building a UI library supported by the design system is either using <b>[styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)</b>
or good old <b>CSS modules</b> with the addition of CSS custom properties.

#### Styled-components

Pros:
- **Built-in theming** - styled-components is providing a context based ThemeProvider out of the box.
- **Easily maintainable theming** - single source of truth theme object, that includes all the color pallets, spacings, etc.
```css
padding: ${({theme}) => `0 ${theme.spacing.lg}`};
```
- **TypeScript support in writing CSS** - benefits of being CSS in JS/TS, as the main variables are coming from the theme object.
- **Customizable and dynamic** - can easily overwrite theme object and extend styled-components - in the same way that you can access your theme, as shown above, you can also access any
props passed to the component, opening up powerful opportunities to create customizable and dynamic components.
```typescript
const FlexContainerExtended = styled(FlexContainer)`
    flex-direction: column-reverse;
`;
```

Cons:
* **Learning curve** - Often considered a myth, but in my opinion as with any other framework or tool, bringing it into a team and expecting best practices might not be that easy when components are really complex.
* **Separations of concern** - Even though there are ways to differentiate logic and styles, in many cases these 2 worlds still mix. With CSS it is really easy to understand which code changes logic, which one styles.
* **No caching of stylesheets** - Class names are generated dynamically, which can cause issues with caching between builds or renders. With Sass, this issue doesn’t exist.

#### CSS modules with CSS variables

Pros:
- **Separation of logic and styles** - As styles and other logic is separated, it makes HTML a lot more clear.
- **Working with regular (S)CSS** - You can use stylelint, SCSS mixins, functions, variables, etc
- **Most mature option** - by now it's almost 100% standardized

Cons:
- **Global styles** - Even though you can write global styles you must use a syntax that does not belong to the CSS specification.
- **Not as flexible theming** - Even though you could utilize CSS variables for it, it's not quite on the same level as using styled-components

### Conclusion

I would choose Styled components when:
- **Creating a UI library for multiple projects** - Every project could customize it for their needs.
- **Multiple themes with different styles** - as styled-components is really flexible because of the nature of writing JS in CSS, it's a lot more convenient to apply different styles depending on theme.

I would choose CSS modules when
- **Projects are using SCSS** - UI library can export so much more than just components - helper variables, mixins, CSS keyframes, etc
- **Opting for a safe option long term** - CSS is here to stay and will be here for years to come - can't say that about styled-components with the same certainty.
- **Different developers maintaining code** - CSS in JS is still a bit controversial in my opinion, and some heavily dislike it. Going with SCSS is a lot safer option in that sense.

### Tools for building, demonstrating and maintaining your UI library

#### Bit.dev
It's a platform that manages all your reusable components. It makes it easy to version components separately and update the dependencies. Testing, documentation, versioning are all handled by 1 platform.

#### Storybook
Storybook is more of a tool to build components in isolation. You can easily document, display and test your components there.

#### Static docs site
Sites to document and display your design system and UI components. Some popular options are for example [React Styleguidist](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist) and [Docz](https://www.docz.site/).

#### What I would use?
If I were to start a large-scale project and would need a great out-of-the-box solution, I would definitely go with **[bit.dev](https://bit.dev/)**. Going with modular applications and maintaining packages as separate entities is the way to go in my opinion.

For constructing a UI library for documentation and display purposes I would choose [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), as there is a lot of tools and addons available for different needs.
For a more customizable option, I would choose any of the static docs generators.
