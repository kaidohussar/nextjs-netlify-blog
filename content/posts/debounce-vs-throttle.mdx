<em>
  Even though debounce and throttle both are used to have control over{' '}
  <b>how often a function or code is executed</b>, they are a bit different.
</em>

<em>
  In this post you will learn what debounce and throttling are, why we use them
  and what are the differences between these two.
</em>

## Debounce

Debouncing forces a function to <b>wait a certain amount of time before running again</b>. This time also acts
as a cooldown and for example when spam calling a debounced function, the cooldown will never reset and the function <b>is never called</b>.
Only when the time between two function calls is <b>more than the predefined cooldown value</b>, the function is called.

### TypeScript implementation:

```typescript
type Procedure = (...args: any[]) => void

export function debounce<F extends Procedure>(
  func: F,
  wait = 300,
  immediate = true,
): (this: ThisParameterType<F>, ...args: Parameters<F>) => void {
  let timeout: ReturnType<typeof setTimeout> | undefined | null

  return function (this: ThisParameterType<F>, ...args: Parameters<F>) {
    const context = this
    const callNow = immediate && !timeout

    if (timeout) clearTimeout(timeout)

    timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      if (timeout) timeout = null

      if (!immediate) func.apply(context, args)
    }, wait)

    if (callNow) func.apply(context, args)
  }
}
```

### Some common use cases

- <b>Search input</b> - Often times we want to use the user input to search or find
  something from a database or from some 3rd party API - this will help to prevent
  spamming your API's.
- <b>Resize/Scroll/Mousemove listeners</b> - Having listeners on either scroll or
  resize events might invoke a function way too often. For example if you want to
  do some height or width calculations based on window size, it probably would be
  a lot more performant do limit the frequency.

Keep in mind that your function will be executed <b>after</b> the user has finished or stopped to do these actions (scrolling/resizing/moving/typing). Because <b>during these actions</b> the cooldown period is most likely never passed.

### Example

Here we have a search input where the `handleChange()` function will be called when the cooldown period of <b>300ms is passed</b>

<img width={400} src="/images/debounced-search.webp" alt="Debounced search" />

#### Without debouncing:

<img width={400} src="/images/regular-search.webp" alt="Regular search" />

#### React code example:

```jsx
const SearchInput = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('')

  const handleChange = ({ target }: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    setValue(target.value)
  }

  const handleDebouncedOnChange = useMemo(() => {
    return debounce(handleChange, 300, false)
  }, [])

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Debounced search:
        <input onChange={handleDebouncedOnChange} />
        <div>{value}</div>
      </label>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Throttle

To throttle a function means to ensure that the function is <b>called at most once in a specified time period</b> (for instance, once every 2 seconds).
Throttling also ensures a function is run regularly at a fixed rate.

### TypeScript implementation:

```typescript
type Procedure = (...args: never[]) => void

export function throttle<F extends Procedure>(
  func: F,
  wait = 300,
): (this: ThisParameterType<F>, ...args: Parameters<F>) => void {
  let lastTime = 0

  return function (this: ThisParameterType<F>, ...args: Parameters<F>) {
    const context = this
    const now = Date.now()
    if (now - lastTime >= wait) {
      func.apply(context, args)
      lastTime = now
    }
  }
}
```

### Some common use cases

- **Games** - Let's say we have shooting game where a particular weapon shoots at most 1 bullet in every second. Although the
  user might spam the SHOOT button, throttling will help to call the `shootWeapon()` at most every 1s.
- **Event listeners** - If you want to do a consistent action on `resize`, `scroll`, `mousemove` or other similar events.
- **Button clicks**
- **API calls**

### Example

Here we have an example, where `handleClick()` function is called at most every 1s

<img width={400} src="/images/throttled-click.webp" alt="Throttled click" />

#### Without throttling:

<img width={400} src="/images/regular-click.webp" alt="Regular click" />

#### React code example:

```jsx
const ClickCounter = () => {
  const [clickCounter, setClickCounter] = useState(0)

  const handleClick = () => {
    setClickCounter((prevState) => prevState + 1)
  }

  const handleThrottledClick = useMemo(() => {
    return throttle(handleClick, 1000)
  }, [setClickCounter])

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleThrottledClick}>Click me</button>

      <div>Click counter: {clickCounter}</div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Conclusion

Hopefully this post will help to eliminate any confusion of what are the debounce and throttle methods and what are the differences between them.
