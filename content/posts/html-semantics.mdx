<em>
  Semantic HTML introduces meaning to the web page rather than just
  presentation.
</em>

Writing semantic HTML is about creating web content that is readable to both humans and computers. It's pretty much mandatory if you want your website to be <b>accessible to all users</b>,
to have a <b>high search engine ranking</b> and to be <b>readable to developers</b> who are interacting with it.

## Benefits of good semantic HTML

### Better SEO

Search engines crawl the web and index your webpage. Good semantic markup makes webpages more informative, adaptable and easier for search engines to interpret the content.

### Helping screen readers

Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page. One of the first things screen readers do is they scan the Document Object Model (DOM) and retrieve information about the page.

### Readable code

It's a lot easier to read & understand code - rather than having multiple meaningless `<div>`'s the HTML structure has a stricter layout and sets boundaries of which type of content is expected.

### Use semantic names to name components

Knowing the correct semantic markup helps naming components in your web app.

## Example of good semantic HTML:

```html
<header>
  <nav aria-label="main navigation">
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#">Main navigation link 1</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Main navigation link 2</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Main navigation link 3</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>

<main>
  <h1>Page title</h1>

  <aside>
    <nav aria-label="navigation area 2">
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Sidebar navigation link 1</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Sidebar navigation link 2</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Sidebar navigation link 3</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </aside>

  <section aria-labelledby="section-1">
    <h2 id="section-1">Section title</h2>
  </section>

  <section aria-labelledby="section-2">
    <h2 id="section-2">Section title</h2>
  </section>
</main>
```

#### Key takeaways from this example markup:

- Wrap your navigation elements within the `<nav>` tag. This is equivalent of doing `<div role="navigation">`
- Having multiple `<nav>` tags is totally fine, just have them labelled to provide context.
- Using more than one `h1` is allowed by the HTML specification, but is not considered a best practice. Using only one `h1` is beneficial for screenreader users.
- The main content of your page should be inside the `<main>` tag, and sidebar which is related to main content should be inside `<aside>` - section that relates to the main content, yet can stand alone when separated.
- `<section>` tags should have `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby` or `title` properties, otherwise the accessible role of `region`, that we would often want with `<section>` element is [not added](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/landmarks/HTML5.html).
- Use `aria-labelledby` to reference **other elements on the page** to define an accessible name if possible.

## Semantic HTML elements and use cases

Even though there are roughly [100 semantic elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) available, this article will be focusing on these ones (more will be added in the future):

<nav>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <anchor href="#article">article</anchor>
    </li>
    <li>
      <anchor href="#section">section</anchor>
    </li>
    <li>
      <anchor href="#aside">aside</anchor>
    </li>
    <li>
      <anchor href="#nav">nav</anchor>
    </li>
    <li>
      <anchor href="#main">main</anchor>
    </li>
    <li>
      <anchor href="#header">header</anchor>
    </li>
    <li>
      <anchor href="#footer">footer</anchor>
    </li>
    <li>
      <anchor href="#mark">mark</anchor>
    </li>
    <li>
      <anchor href="#details">details</anchor>
    </li>
    <li>
      <anchor href="#summary">summary</anchor>
    </li>
    <li>
      <anchor href="#figure">figure</anchor>
    </li>
    <li>
      <anchor href="#figcaption">figcaption</anchor>
    </li>
    <li>
      <anchor href="#time">time</anchor>
    </li>
  </ul>
</nav>

<h3 id="article">article</h3>

The `<article>` element represents a complete, or self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site.

#### Examples where to use:

- newspaper article
- blog post
- user submitted comment
- any independent item of content

#### Things to remember:

- `<article>` content should have a heading `<h1>`-`<h6>`.
- An `<article>` should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the site.
- When nested, the inner `<article>` should be related to the contents of the parent `<article>`. For example blog post comments could be inside `<article>` tags, but the blog post itself is also wrapped inside `<article>`.

<hr />

<h3 id="section">section</h3>

A `<section>` tag represents a standalone section of a document.

#### Examples where to use:

- On a page with distinct sections

```html
<h1>User settings</h1>
<section aria-labelledby="section-1">
  <h2 id="section-1">Change email</h2>
  ...
</section>

<section aria-labelledby="section-2">
  <h2 id="section-2">Change password</h2>
  ...
</section>
```

#### Things to remember:

- `<section>` content should usually have a heading `<h1>`-`<h6>`, but there are few [exceptions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section#using_a_section_without_a_heading).
- Should be only used when there isn't a more specific element to use.
- Assistive technologies often provide ways for users to quickly navigate to a specific section.
- Add `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby` or `title` properties to apply the role of `region`.

<hr />

<h3 id="aside">aside</h3>

The `<aside>` HTML element represents a section of a page whose content is only indirectly related to the page's main content.

#### Examples where to use:

- Sidebar
- Pull quote (section of the article pulled out of its context and repeated to give either emphasis, or to aid the reader in scanning the article)

```html
<p>Text content</p>
<aside>
  <q>Pull quote</q>
</aside>
<p>Text content continues</p>
```

- Advertising
- Other content that is considered separate from the main content of the page

#### Things to remember:

- If `<aside>` is used within a `<section>` or an `<article>` tags, the content should be related to it.

<hr />

<h3 id="nav">nav</h3>

The `<nav>` HTML element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigational links, either within the current document or to other documents.

#### Examples where to use:

- Header navigation
- Menus
- Tables of content
- Indexes

#### Things to remember:

- Using HTML element `nav` applies the role of `navigation`.
- For example when setting up links in the `footer`, there is no need for `nav` element.
- Having multiple `nav` elements in a single page is fine, but be sure to provide `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` when doing so.
- Don't overuse it - not all links should be inside a `nav` tag, but **only major navigation blocks**
- The `nav` tag cannot be nested in the `address` element.

<hr />

<h3 id="main">main</h3>

The `main` HTML element represents the dominant content of the `body` of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.

#### Examples where to use:

- Main content of the page

#### Things to remember:

- Using it applies the role of `main`, but prefer using the element when possible (not supported in IE).
- It can be a target of a skip navigation link - so that assistive technology users could access main content of the page faster, if they wish.
- `<main>` "represents the main content of the body of a document or application", while `<body>` "represents the content of the document".
- The `<main>` element can only be used once in each HTML file, don't put it inside tags such as `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, `<header>` or `<nav>`

<hr />

<h3 id="header">header</h3>

`<header>` can be used as a header for a whole page (the most common usage), but can also be used as the header for an **article** or **any other piece of on-page content**.

#### Examples where to use:

- Page header

```jsx
<header>
  <a src="/" id="logo">
    Site Title
  </a>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="/">Home</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/about">About</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/contact">Contact</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>
```

- Section/article header

#### Things to remember:

- A single HTML document can have multiple `<header>` elements. A `<header>` is always related to the element that contains it.
- When using it in an `article` or `section`, a heading (`<h1>`â€“`<h6>`) element is commonly added.

<hr />

<h3 id="footer">footer</h3>

The `footer` element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element. A footer typically contains information about its section such as who wrote it, links to related documents, copyright data, and the like.

#### Examples where to use:

- Copyright info
- Contact details
- Links to pages
- Section actions

#### Things to remember:

- When it is an immediate descendant of the `<body>` using the `<footer>` element will automatically communicate a section has a role of `contentinfo`
- `footer` element nested within an `article`, `aside`, `main`, `nav`, or `section` is not considered `contentinfo`.

<hr />

<h3 id="mark">mark</h3>

```html
<p>You searched for "blocked":</p>

<hr />

<p>
  If your account is <mark>blocked</mark> go through the password recovery flow
  to unblock it.
</p>
```

The `<mark>` HTML element represents text which is marked or highlighted for reference or notation purposes

#### Examples where to use:

- Inside `blockquote` to mark text interesting/relevant to the user.
- Highlighting search results

#### Things to remember:

- The presence of the mark element is not announced by most screen reading technology. It can be made to be announced by using the CSS `content` property, along with the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements.
- By default, most browsers render text within `<mark>` tags as black text on a yellow background

<hr />

<h3 id="details">details</h3>

```html
<details>
  <summary>Summary</summary>
  More info
</details>
```

The `<details>` element is used to pair a `<summary>` statement with additional related details. The `<summary>` is displayed, and a user can view or hide additional details by clicking on the `summary`.

#### Examples where to use:

- Frequently asked questions page

#### Things to remember:

- Usually paired with `summary` element
- When there is not a `summary` element found, browsers will display a text "Details" instead

<hr />

<h3 id="summary">summary</h3>

The `<summary>` HTML element specifies a summary, caption, or legend for a `<details>` element's disclosure box. Clicking the `<summary>` element toggles the state of the parent `<details>` element open and closed.

#### Examples where to use:

- Frequently asked questions page

#### Things to remember:

- The `<summary>` element should be the first child element of the `<details>` element

<hr />

<h3 id="figure">figure</h3>

```html
<figure>
  <img src="lion.png" />
  <figcaption>Lion in the wild</figcaption>
</figure>
```

The `<figure>` HTML element represents self-contained content, potentially with an optional caption, which is specified using the `<figcaption>` element. The figure, its caption, and its contents are referenced as a single unit.

#### Examples where to use:

- Image
- Illustration
- Diagram
- Code snippet

#### Things to remember:

<hr />

<h3 id="figcaption">figcaption</h3>

The `<figcaption>` HTML element represents a caption or legend describing the rest of the contents of its parent `<figure>` element.

#### Examples where to use:

- Image
- Illustration
- Diagram
- Code snippet

#### Things to remember:

- When used with images, usually the `alt` tag should be empty when using `figcaption`, otherwise screen readers will read the info twice.

<hr />

<h3 id="time">time</h3>

```html
<p>The concert starts at <time datetime="20:00">20:00</time></p>
```

The `<time>` HTML element represents a specific period in time. It may include the `datetime` attribute to translate dates into machine-readable format, allowing for better search engine results or custom features such as reminders.

#### Examples where to use:

- When displaying time periods
- When displaying a date for a specific event

#### Things to remember:

- The `datetime` value (the machine-readable value of the datetime) is the value of the element's datetime attribute, which must be in the correct format.

It may represent one of the following:

- A time on a 24-hour clock.
- A precise date in the [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar) (with optional time and timezone information).
- [A valid time duration](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-microsyntaxes.html#valid-duration-string).

## Final words

Constructing this article and researching about this topic has made me realize how common it is to write <b>semantically incorrect HTML</b> . So often I see a sea of `<div>` 's when in reality many more suitable elements could be used.

Hopefully this article provided enough information and examples to inspire writing more <b>semantically correct HTML</b>.
