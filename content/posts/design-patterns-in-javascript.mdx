    In this post I will go over commonly used design patterns in JavaScript, to give you a better idea on what are the <b>use-cases for each pattern</b>, and <b>why you should use them</b>.
</em>

## Definition

Design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.
A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

## Why should you use them?
Design patterns are largely a structured template for problem-solving in software development - it makes the overall system a lot more **easier to understand**, **maintainable** and **makes the communcation between developers efficient**.

Also, they are:
* **Proven solutions**: Being used and tested for years, you can be certain that they were revised and optimized multiple times.
* **Easily reusable**: Design patterns document a reusable solution which can be modified to solve multiple particular problems, as they are not tied to a specific problem.

## History of Design patterns

Since its inception, the concept of design pattern has been around in the programming world. But it was not formalized till 1994 when one of the most influential work was published called <b>“Design Patterns: Elements Of Reusable Object-Oriented Software”</b> – written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides – a group that became known as the <b>Gang of Four (or GoF)</b>.

In this book, 23 object-oriented design patterns are featured. Since then, the “pattern approach” became popular in the software engineering industry, and after that, dozens of other patterns have been discovered.

[Design Patterns: Elements Of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://github.com/amilajack/reading/blob/master/Design/GOF%20Design%20Patterns.pdf) PDF

It is to be noted that a few of the classic design patterns mentioned in the GoF book have reduced relevance over time. Hence they will be omitted, and modern patterns from sources like [Addy Osmani’s Learn JavaScript Design Patterns](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/) will be included in this post.

## Categories of Design patterns

### > Creational Design Pattern
These patterns focus on handling object creation mechanisms.
Few patterns that fall under this category are – Constructor, Factory, Prototype, Singleton, etc.

### > Structural Design Patterns
These patterns are concerned with object composition. They explain simple ways to assemble objects and classes into larger structures. They help ensure that when one part of a system changes,
the entire structure of the system doesn’t need to do the same, keeping them flexible and efficient. Few patterns that fall under this category are – Module, Decorator, Facade, Adapter, Proxy, etc.

### > Behavioral Design Patterns
These patterns focus on improving the communication and assignment of responsibilities between dissimilar objects in a system.
Few patterns that fall under this category are – Chain of Responsibility, Command, Observer, Iterator, Strategy, Template, etc.

## Design patterns

As there are many different patterns, I will go over some of the most popular ones or the ones, that seem relevant to me.

### Factory pattern

### Singleton pattern

### Strategy pattern
